      StudentsResources was founded on 3/9/2021 as a side project by RG2N. He was learning css, js and html at the time. He made it for fun and as a side project and as a secret cheat sheet for people in his class. He worked on it for a bit then realised the ability of html and used it's full potential to create StudentsResources.
